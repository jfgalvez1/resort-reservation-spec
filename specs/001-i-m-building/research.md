# Research: Modern Resort Reservation System

**Phase**: 0 - Research & Technology Decisions  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Feature**: Modern Resort Reservation System

## Technology Stack Research

### Next.js 14+ with Static Site Generation

**Decision**: Use Next.js 14+ with app directory and static export  
**Rationale**: 
- Provides excellent static site generation capabilities
- Built-in performance optimizations (image optimization, code splitting)
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Excellent developer experience with hot reloading
- SEO-friendly with server-side rendering capabilities (even in static mode)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Vite + React: Good performance but requires more configuration for static generation
- Gatsby: Excellent for static sites but more complex for simple applications
- Astro: Great for content-heavy sites but overkill for this application

### Tailwind CSS 3.4+

**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling  
**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach enables rapid development
- Excellent mobile-first responsive design capabilities
- Small bundle size with purging unused styles
- Excellent integration with Next.js
- Consistent design system with minimal configuration

**Alternatives considered**:
- Styled Components: Runtime overhead and larger bundle size
- CSS Modules: More verbose and less consistent
- Material-UI: Too opinionated for custom resort branding

### Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Jest + React Testing Library  
**Rationale**:
- Jest: Industry standard for React testing with excellent TypeScript support
- React Testing Library: Focuses on testing user behavior rather than implementation
- Visual regression testing: Ensures UI consistency across changes

**Alternatives considered**:
- Vitest: Faster than Jest but less mature ecosystem
- Testing Library + Jest: Standard combination with excellent documentation

### Mock Data Strategy

**Decision**: JSON files with TypeScript interfaces  
**Rationale**:
- Simple to implement and maintain
- Type-safe with TypeScript interfaces
- Easy to modify for testing scenarios
- No database complexity for initial development
- Can be easily replaced with real API later

**Alternatives considered**:
- In-memory database (SQLite): Overkill for static site
- External API: Adds complexity and external dependencies
- Local storage: Not suitable for server-side rendering

## Performance Research

### Image Optimization

**Decision**: Next.js Image component with WebP format  
**Rationale**:
- Automatic image optimization and lazy loading
- Multiple format support (WebP, AVIF fallbacks)
- Responsive image generation
- CDN-friendly with proper caching headers

### Bundle Optimization

**Decision**: Next.js built-in optimizations + Tailwind purging  
**Rationale**:
- Automatic code splitting by Next.js
- Tree shaking for unused code
- Tailwind CSS purging removes unused styles
- Static generation eliminates runtime JavaScript overhead

## Accessibility Research

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

**Decision**: Semantic HTML + ARIA attributes + keyboard navigation  
**Rationale**:
- Next.js provides semantic HTML structure
- React components can easily include ARIA attributes
- Tailwind CSS supports focus states and screen reader utilities
- Progressive enhancement ensures core functionality without JavaScript

## Mobile-First Design Research

### Responsive Breakpoints

**Decision**: Tailwind CSS default breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)  
**Rationale**:
- Industry-standard breakpoints
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Consistent across all components
- Easy to customize if needed

### Touch Interactions

**Decision**: Touch-friendly components with proper sizing  
**Rationale**:
- Minimum 44px touch targets
- Proper spacing between interactive elements
- Swipe gestures for calendar navigation
- Hover states that work on touch devices

## Calendar Component Research

### Calendar Library Options

**Decision**: Custom React component with date-fns for date manipulation  
**Rationale**:
- Full control over styling and behavior
- Lightweight compared to full calendar libraries
- Easy to customize for resort-specific needs
- date-fns provides excellent date utilities with tree-shaking

**Alternatives considered**:
- react-big-calendar: Too complex for simple date selection
- FullCalendar: Heavy and overkill for basic calendar
- react-datepicker: Good but limited customization options

## Authentication Mock Strategy

**Decision**: Local storage with mock user sessions  
**Rationale**:
- Simple to implement for development
- No external dependencies
- Easy to test different user scenarios
- Can be replaced with real authentication later

## Deployment Strategy

**Decision**: Static hosting (Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages)  
**Rationale**:
- Perfect for Next.js static export
- Global CDN distribution
- Automatic HTTPS
- Easy CI/CD integration
- Cost-effective for static sites

## Research Summary

All technology decisions align with the constitutional requirements:
- ✅ Static-first architecture with Next.js
- ✅ Progressive enhancement with React
- ✅ Performance optimization with built-in tools
- ✅ Accessibility with semantic HTML and ARIA
- ✅ Test-first approach with comprehensive testing strategy

The chosen stack provides an excellent foundation for a modern, performant, and accessible resort reservation system.
