# Feature Specification: Modern Resort Reservation System

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-m-building`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I'm building a modern, resort reservation system designed to stand out visually and functionally. It will feature an elegant landing page showcasing the resort's view to create an immersive first impression. The system will include a user dashboard that tracks expenses and earnings with detailed insights across daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly periods. A reservation page will use a calendar-style interface with stamped or marked dates to clearly indicate reserved slots. Additionally, there will be an About page highlighting the resort's story and features, and a FAQ page to address common questions and improve the user experience."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A potential guest visits the resort website to explore the property, view available dates, and make a reservation. The system provides an immersive visual experience showcasing the resort's amenities and creates a seamless booking process with clear availability indicators.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor lands on the homepage, **When** they view the resort showcase, **Then** they see high-quality images and compelling content that creates an immersive first impression
2. **Given** a user wants to make a reservation, **When** they navigate to the reservation page, **Then** they see a calendar interface with clearly marked available and reserved dates
3. **Given** a user has made reservations, **When** they access their dashboard, **Then** they can view their expense and earnings tracking with detailed insights across different time periods
4. **Given** a user wants to learn about the resort, **When** they visit the About page, **Then** they can read the resort's story and key features
5. **Given** a user has questions, **When** they visit the FAQ page, **Then** they can find answers to common questions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when all dates are fully booked for a requested period?
- How does the system handle users trying to book dates that are already reserved?
- What happens when a user tries to access dashboard features without being logged in?
- How does the system handle users with multiple reservations across different time periods?
